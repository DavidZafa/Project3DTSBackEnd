An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.<br/><br/>I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful.<br/><br/>I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right?<br/><br/>If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them.<br/><br/>Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!<br/><br/>I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? I know words. I have the best words. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them.<br/><br/>All of the words in Lorem Ipsum have flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.<br/><br/>I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. I think the only card she has is the Lorem card."

    "post": "<p>Let all these things just sort of happen. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.</p><p>Poor old tree. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds.</p><p>If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. What the devil.</p><p>The light is your friend. Preserve it. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Get tough with it, get strong.</p><p>In your world you have total and absolute power. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Let your heart be your guide.</p><p>Let your imagination be your guide. We'll play with clouds today. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Brown is such a nice color. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here.</p><p>Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Don't fight it, use what happens.</p>"
